### Overview

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. The dataset is fetched from sklearn.datasets using fetch_openml and is commonly referred to as MNIST_784.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image represents a single digit, and the task is to train a model to correctly classify them.

Model Used
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier:
The SGD classifier is employed for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets. It is particularly suitable for online learning and large-scale machine learning tasks.
